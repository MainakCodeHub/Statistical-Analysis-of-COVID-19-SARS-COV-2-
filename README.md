# Statistical-Analysis-of-COVID-19-SARS-COV-2
The main objective of the project is to find out the dependencies of the attributes such as gender, patient status, age etc. 	Collecting the data from Kaggle (Covid-19 spreading across all the states of India) and pre-processed has been performed due to large no of missing values to avoid biasedness. The data has a total of 15 attributes and except for age all attribute data types are strings. 
Further replaced the value of gender, transmission type & status with nominal data. 
Next, we found the relationship between gender (Male & Female), Age groups (less than 18-19 to 40-41 and greater than 65) and the current physical status (recovered, hospitalized, and deceased) of the affected patient. 
To find the dependencies, Chi-square test has been performed.
